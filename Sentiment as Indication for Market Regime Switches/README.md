# Sentiment as Indication for Market Regime Switches

By Macro Summarizer

This is the code to the research project on sentiment as a regime indicator. 

**Abstract:**
*In this study, Sentiment is evaluated on its ability to indicate a regime switch. It is found, that while declining in effectiveness, investor sentiment, to this date of the study, is a useful measure to evaluate market risk regimes.
The study also finds and tests optimal levels of sentiment spread to effectively switch between regimes. It is interpreted that if the sentiment spread between bullish and bearish investors is high, uncertainty of the market participants is high and the market corrects, usually accompanied with higher volatility. When the spread is low, there is a common theme across investors, resulting in confidence and risk-on regimes, thus beneficial for equities. The conclusion is that investors can use sentiment levels to adjust their risk or asset class allocation in their employed strategies.*
